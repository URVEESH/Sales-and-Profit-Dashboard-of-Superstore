# Sales-and-Profit-Dashboard-of-Superstore

Collaboratively led a Tableau project with a focus on enhancing business insights for a Superstore. Teaming up with a partner, we developed an interactive dashboard for in-depth analysis of sales and profit data. Our joint efforts involved applying statistical techniques within Tableau to uncover patterns and forecast future trends. The project resulted in translating complex data into actionable insights, empowering the Superstore with informed decision-making capabilities. This collaborative experience showcased effective teamwork and strengthened our skills in data analysis and visualization.
